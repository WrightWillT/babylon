However, if we choose each character by its likelihood in any position as well as with a weight for coming after the preceding character ('h' being more common after 't' and 's'), then we can hope to build words that seem to make sense.  Still, hard rules could be set where two constonant must have a vowel after unless those two exact preceeding characters occur in the corpus in a row. Something like that anway.  We'd want to have levers on the degrees of being one way or the other and test it out to get the frequencies right.\n",
